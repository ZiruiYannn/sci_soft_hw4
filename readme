Step1 Before compiling the code and running the executable, go to the Src folder first.

Step2 Use Makefile to generate the executable.

Practical infomation:
    simulation3.cpp is for generating the simulation results of predictions of the observations

    siqrd.hpp: contains the function and Jacobian for siqrd
    simple_ode: contains the function and Jacobian for ODEs
    ivp_solver: contains the class ivp. The class ivp has member functions simu_forward, simu_backward and simu_heun which do the simulations.
    io_siqrd: contains all the read and write functions I need. 
    bfgs: contains the class bfgs. The class bfgs has member functions BFGS_forward, BFGS_backward and BFGS_heun.
